## Figma Plugin to copy all first level layer names in console

Figma Plugin to print all first level layer/frame/artboard names in console.

Keep in mind this is a raw, scrappy figma plugin that you have to load it as developer plugin and open console to copy the layer names. It's not packaged as a ready-to-use plugin yet.
